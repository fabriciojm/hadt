# ECG Heartbeat Examples

This dataset contains example ECG heartbeats and short ecgs taken with apple smartwatches. Sources:
- Single heartbeats were taken from [MIT-BIH dataset preprocess into heartbeat Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talal92/mit-bih-dataset-preprocess-into-heartbeat-python)
  - The dataset above was derived from the [Original MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset on PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). That dataset contains half-hour annotated ECGs from 48 patients.
- Short 30-second ECGs taken with apple watches.

These examples are part of the **Heart Arrhythmia Detection Tools (hadt) Project** ([hadt GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fabriciojm/hadt)) and are intended for educational and research purposes.
A demo where the dataset is used can be found in the [hadt demo](https://fabriciojm-hadt-app.hf.space/).
